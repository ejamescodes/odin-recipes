    <h3>A Delicious Chicken Cutlet with a Saucy Egg Coating</h3>
    <p>This is a Portuguese inspired dish consisting of a fried chicken cutlet coated in flour and egg</p>
    <p>It is usually served with tartar sauce along with sidedishes such as salad and egg salad</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 chicken breast</li>
        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar
        </li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>olive oil (for shallow frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make an inscision down the middle of the chicken breast so it is butterflied</li>
        <li>Make small cuts on the surface of the chicken breast to increase surface area</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken breast in flour leaving no part exposed</li>
        <li>Dip the flour coated chicken breast in a beaten egg until it has adhered to all of the flour on the surface</li>
        <li>Oil and preheat a frying pan until it starts lightly smoking</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken breast until golden and it reaches an internal temperature of 165F/74C</li>
        <li>In a seperate bowl mix together the soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, and sugar</li>
        <li>Dip the cooked chicken cutlet the bowl with the sauce mixture</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy on top of a salad with fresh egg salad and tartar sauce</p>
    <p>I thought that this was a delicious dish. The egg coating locked in the moisture of the chicken breast. It was quick and easy to prepare, making it a mid-week meal I'll be returning to in the future.</p>
